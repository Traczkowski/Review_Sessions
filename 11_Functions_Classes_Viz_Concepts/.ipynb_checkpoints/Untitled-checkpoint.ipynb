    "# Classes, Functions, and Data Visualization concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Today, we're going to talk a little bit about function and class best-practices within Python and Object Oriented Programming in general, and then we'll switch gears a little bit to talk about some data visualization and dashboarding concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes and Object Oriented Programming vs. Functional Programing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Though there are 4 main programming styles that are likely to be the most-often used in Python, they are the following...\n",
    "- Functional\n",
    "- Imperative\n",
    "- Object-Oriented (OOP)\n",
    "- Procedural\n",
    "- source (https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/python-programming-styles/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### We're going to talk a little bit today about OOP (which is Python has some slight issues with depending who you ask) as well as functional programming today. The reason that some people percieve Python to have some issues with this is that it is not able to encapsulate attributes as private in the sort of most optimal way. We'll talk a little bit about \"name-mangling\" (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encapsulation-in-python/) but I do recommend reading up a little bit more on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes: Classes are a building block of object-oriented programming within Python, they are used to create the actual objects themselves, and you can think about a class as the specific instructions that you'd need to create one of these objects. Classes can include a ton of different things that are important for the object... From things that the object can do (you can have functions within the object), to properties about that object, there is a lot that you can think about when first building out a class...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some examples of this that I like to think about when I'm trying to understand classes are ones that can be manufactures with options...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Electronics... Think about a factory with all of the capabilities to build several different electronics. You have machines that can assemble screens, clean rooms in which you can build microchips, CNC machines that can mill phone or laptop cases, etc all under one roof just waiting to be configured. You can think about using a class to select which type of electronic to manufacture along with which parameters that item should have...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom shoes or clothes. If I have a class \"Shoe\", it can be built up from several different outsole materials, insole materials, colors, it can have several sizes, it can use different closures (velcro, shoelaces, laceless, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A car. I think that cars are a great example of objects that can be cleverly built by classes. If you think about a car that exists in several versions such as the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, you have a car with one name that can exist as a coupe, convertiple, sedan, or wagon and regardless of which body-style you go for, there will be variety in the engines, trim levels, colors, options, etc. etc. that will affect pricing, availability, etc. We will be talking about classes with this example in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nearly anything else that can be manufactured with different options. Sure, you can use an item which should always be manufactured with the same parameters to think about classe and objects, but the truth is that the flexibility to create different types of objects with the same class is part of what makes it such a powerful concept. Let's talk a little bit about some items that can be neatly abstracted into classes at this point...\n",
