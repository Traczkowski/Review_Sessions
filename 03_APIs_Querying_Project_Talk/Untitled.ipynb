    "#### First, I wanted to discuss a little bit about different Library and API documentation...\n",
    "- There is a huge variety of developers out there, some with more time, some with less.\n",
    "- You'll see a different level of effort in different documentation. I see within my own organization all of the time that we have developers who would rather keep on coding, and that coming up with documentation is a hard process on my product manager.\n",
    "- We are often asked about api documentation in class, and the truth is that outside of the fairly standard \"api key\", and the fairly wide adoption of JSON (though there are different commonly used formats like XML), the world of APIs is pretty wild west.\n",
    "- What that means is that support for different languages may be spotty, pricing schemes may vary wildly, ability to contact the team that is producing the data can be tough, and even performance may be different!\n",
    "- As with everything in the computing/data world, tehre are best-practices out there, but how effectively they are followed also varies hugely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Often, outside of Googling, you have 2 very solid options\n",
    "- Go right to the source (EX: Twitter documentation at https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs). If the original team that built the API has good documentation, that will likely be the best place to go!\n",
    "- You'll also find that https://readthedocs.org/ is a very good resource for Library and API documentation as well, you may have already found yourself on their site already, and there seems to be good reason for that. They are an aggregator, and their community attempts to bring similarly structured API documentation to the broader world of APIs\n",
    "- For unique \"How can I do X with Y api/library/framework?\" questions, you can still always look up a specific article on one of the blogs you've likely taken a liking to by this point in the cohort (EX: https://towardsdatascience.com/accessing-google-calendar-events-data-using-python-e915599d3ae2)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To provide some additional context, I wanted to talk about how APIs are used in different parts of an organization\n",
    "- We have already discussed in class that there are obvious uses throughout many organizations and that there is a slew of use-cases for different APIs\n",
    "- Wanted to talk about some real-world applications that I've seen out in the field and open it up to anybody that is data-adjacent already and would maybe want to share a bit of their experience with it.\n",

    "- EX 2: As your company generates data, your clients may ask for certain reports to be passed to them programatically. This can be handled by using an api connection.\n",
    "- EX 3: If your client is generating data that is relevant to you... For example, you make smart lightbulbs that monitor temperature of whatever facility that they are installed in, but once you have sold the bulbs to your client, they aggregate all of the data from those bulbs and then pass it back to you in JSON format because they have built a clever API.\n",
