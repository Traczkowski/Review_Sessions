As I mentioned last week, if you are in a bigger organization with a larger data footprint, you won't really have the luxury of being able to look at the \"whole\" database, but so long as you're working with a smaller amount of tables, you can actually get a lot out of the ER diagram tool to iterate on queries more quickly and help you learn the best ways to join the data in your database efficiently.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Foreign keys can also be null (EX: In the same transactions table as above, we have the phone_number column as a foreign key, but customer 1234 never gave us their number, so for every transaction, we will see NULL in the phone_number column when that customer was part of a transaction.)\n",

    "### To wrap up for today, the needs of your organization are always going to be shifting, but the more that you can do to empower the people in your company to be connected to the underlying data the better, and you can always start with yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "- As you'll become more friendly with communicating with SQL and NoSQL databases more effectively over the coming weeks/months/years, you'll be able to aggregate data to answer questions in ways that would have been tricky for you to even consider in the past. Anecdotally, I'd say that ~30-40% of my day is spent in DBeaver looking at tables and how to join them/roll them up in different ways, and the rest of my day is spent in Python, continuing to clean that data, analyzing it, visualizing it, modeling, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ability to query against multiple databases and bringing the results directly back into your computer's memory will allow you to run all sorts of interesting pandas code to join up all sorts of data! This can also be useful for diagnosis. Keep on trying out different ways of interacting with databases!\n",
    "\n",
    "- You could further the logic above to build out email reports that are sent out at some interval, or what I'm trying to do is build out a stable of canned reports at my company that'd allow data analysts to connect to a jupyter notebook, drop in some pre-defined parameters, and get output either sent to them, bring a result into memory so that they could filter it, etc. etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The possibilities here really are endless, and even though I tried to be quick there are volumes and volumes of things I couldn't get to today. Hope you enjoyed!"
